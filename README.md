# Simple React with A-Frame

This project is powered by a-frame and is so simple.

it has two main parts, VideoScene and a 3D-VR-Space

## Video Scene

loads a 360 video using a-frame, simple.

## 3D Space

this part, I put a little more time into this one, here, you can load almost any 3d model found online(of course not ANY, you are on a browser and do not have the advantage of using full power of GPU, for now).
you can see it in vr space, interact with it and so on.

many commented/deleted code should be there, check commits.

## Messy

I didn't put much time writing this readme, or organizing this project, so, if YOU did, or if you have any ideas lemme know I guess. or don't.
